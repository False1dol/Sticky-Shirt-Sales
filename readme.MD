## Background 
###### There is no efficient way to see yourself in clothes that you want to order online. Currently, some online retailers allow customers to order their clothes and return them if they are unhappy with the purchase. This method is slow and inefficient. There are online stores such as Lenskart Glasses that allow you to upload a portrait of yourself in order to superimpose glasses frames onto your face. This method is a step in the right direction but only allows the superimposition of one specific kind of clothing.

###### There are also apps that allow you to create a type of virtual dressing room. They allow you to upload photos of clothing as well as yourself in order to superimpose the images together to create outfits. Though these apps are nice they are poorly made, only allow for a two-dimensional view and are aimed towards women exclusively.

###### We intend on creating a similar app but one that is far superior. It will allow the users to upload photos of themselves in order to superimpose the clothing on the photos. They will also be able to create a 3D view of themselves from these pictures. This will allow users to view themselves in the clothing before they choose to order the product. This will save time and reduce the number of returns made.

###### Our object is to provide instant feedback to the customer on the style on and fit of the clothing by providing them with a realistic view of them in any clothes they may be interested in purchasing. We intend on increasing customer satisfaction as well and increasing sales volume
